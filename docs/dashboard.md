# Dashboard

The Implementer Dashboard is a built-in web UI served at `/dashboard`. It requires `adminPassword` to be set in the server configuration.

## Authentication

The dashboard uses a cookie-based session (`impl_dash`). On successful login, a SHA-256 hash of the admin password is stored as a cookie. The cookie is scoped to `/dashboard`, HttpOnly, and SameSite=Strict.

## Features

- **Live task stream** — uses Server-Sent Events (`/dashboard/events`) to push updates every 2 seconds
- **Project cards** — shows per-project task counts; click to filter the task list
- **Status filters** — filter tasks by status (running, queued, retrying, completed, failed, interrupted)
- **Task detail modal** — view full task info including prompt, output, error, branch, and pull requests
- **New Task modal** — submit a new task from the UI, selecting project and writing a prompt
- **Retry task** — retry a failed or interrupted task from the task detail modal
- **Light/dark mode toggle** — theme preference persisted in `localStorage` under the key `impl-theme`

## Light/Dark Mode

The dashboard supports both dark mode (default) and light mode. A toggle button (☀/☾) appears in the header of both the login page and the main dashboard.

### Implementation

Theming is implemented using CSS custom properties (variables):

- `:root` defines all dark-mode color values
- `[data-theme=light]` overrides the same variables with light-mode values
- The `<html>` element receives `data-theme="light"` when light mode is active
- A small inline script at the top of `<head>` reads `localStorage` and applies the `data-theme` attribute **before** the page renders, preventing a flash of unstyled content (FOUC)
- `localStorage.setItem('impl-theme', 'light')` persists the preference across page loads and navigation between login/dashboard
